BINARY TREE:
  Should have questions relating to terminology.
    Depth                - Find every node matching a certain depth
    Size                 - Find every node with a given size in the tree
    Height               - Find every node with a given height in the tree

    C'est finito.
    
  Should have questions relating to traversing a tree.
    Breadth First Search - Traverse every node in the tree BFS
    Depth First Search   - Traverse every node in the tree DFS
    In-Order Traversal   - Left, parent, right
    Pre-Order Traversal  - Parent, Left, Right
    Post-Order Traversal - Left, Right, Parent

    Done.

  Every question would have selecting nodes, setting nodes as active.
    This logic is very, very similar to find, should be easy to implement.
    DONE

  Needs to build up a tree when initialized, rather than adding to an empty tree.
    Update: This is done. Inside of Operations.js this builds up a tree.
      Constants are defined inside of defs.
