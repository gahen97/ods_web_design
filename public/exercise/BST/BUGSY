- BUG:
  1. Play the traversal animation (for find answer)
  2. While still animating, switch to a different find answer
  3. Run through the question normally (without show answer button)

  If done with correct timing:
    Root will have orange endpoints, black border & text
      Ends up having both path-node & can-set-active class.
      This actually breaks A LOT of other stuff, too.
    Answer will be incorrect:
      Some elements (root +) will be in the list twice.

    Ex. One iteration of 3-12-7 was:
      3 - 12 - 3 - 12 - 7

  Expected Results:
    - Every node in the path should be orange endpoints, orange border, orange text.
    - Path should be only what's in the path-node list:
      3 - 12 - 7 in the example

  Update:
    Should be fixed.
