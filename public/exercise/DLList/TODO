ISSUES
  If a node is added manually, when the view updates, it does not include that node.
    This is because commonId will be different ....... but it shouldn't be.
    What logic can we use for this?
  Restart button will randomly place every node afterwards.
    This is kind of odd and I'm not sure why.
    Also, strangely, it doesn't do this every time -
      and when hunting for it it isn't happening. :/.
    Apparently it can also happen on show answer ... again, I don't know why.
    This'll have to be tested & figured out later.

CHANGES
  Parameters are generated AFTER the model.
  This SEEMS to be working but NEEDS more testing.
  CAPS are fun.
