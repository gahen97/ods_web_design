Exercises used from here are:
	- ArrayStack
	- SortedSet
	- Skiplist
		I (Performing 'find' operations)
		II (Performing add & remove operations)
		III (Using a Skiplist as a list)

Note, for Skiplist 1, 2, and 3:
	All Skiplists use the base code from Skiplist 1.
	Skiplist-II and Skiplist-III alter the base code for their purposes
	For anything ended -a (ex. -iia), the code is altered to perform an add operation.
	  Anything ending -r (ex. -iir) is a remove operation.
	  Anything ending -ii or -iii is default (the base case, usually a find/get/...)

This server is automatically run by the main server and all configurations can be altered inside of
  config.json.
