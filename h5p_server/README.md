## USAGE:
  This server is automatically run by the main server at the host & port listed within the Config.json file.
  To add a video to the server:
    Insert the video folder into lib > h5p-content > InteractiveVideo
  
  To get a video from this server:
    Any request made to /VIDEO_NAME will be served with that video.
    For example, /list will be served with the List video.
    This can be requested from an iframe to load the video into the webpage.

## Sean's edits:
Exercises now work by path sent in the URL:
  ex. localhost:8080/sllist

Video should be placed inside:
  lib -> h5p-content -> InteractiveVideo -> [ name ]

Modules for running the exercise should be placed inside the exercise folder
  under assets with the same name (.html)
  For example, sllist would then be sllist.html
Each should also be a given a folder under views with a render.pug file for rendering
  the exercise,
  and a module under the modules folder (name.js).

Should end up looking like:
  assets
    exercise
      name.html
      modules
        name.js
      views
        name
          render.pug
  h5p-content
    InteractiveVideo
      name
        [h5p content files]

And the server will then accept the connection at localhost:8080/name
  and send back the provided files.
If the video does not have an exercise, it will send back the video without attempting
  to send an exercise (this is if name.html does not exist).

I also added a resizeIframe.js script under exercise that is used with each exercise -
  this way, the exercise height is dynamically adjusted to fit that exercise
  (as the set exercise, for example, was larger than the Sllist and created extra space).


## Gahen's edits:
to run server, navigate to lib and enter the following command: node ../bin/h5p-cli server.

Fixed the exercise section of the html so that it moves with the video as it resizes.

Included the ConfirmationDialog library manually, for the first MCQ to work.

Edited some of the pre-existing code in this library, wouldn't run otherwise. Edit is in "/lib/h5p-libs/H5P.ConfirmationDialog-1.0/scripts/confirmation-dialog.js", "$wrapper.get(0)" changed to "$wrapper"



## Martin's edits:
to run: 
cd lib ; h5p server



## H5P Command Line Interface

A tool that simplifies the development process of [H5P](https://h5p.org) (HTML5 Packages).

The H5P development documentation is found on [h5p.org/developers](https://h5p.org/developers)

Note that this tool is still in alpha!

## Install

`sudo npm install -g h5p`

Make sure ssh-agent is running and that `ssh -T git@github.com` works.

## H5P developer server

The H5P cli tool makes it possible to run a H5P development server using node.js. The server needs some input to be able to start. This input should be placed in a h5p-server.json file, and must contain the following:

```javascript
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 8080,
  "libraryDir": "<name of directory where libraries are found>",
  "mainLibraryDir": "<the directory where the main library is found>",
  "contentDir": "<the directory where content is found>"
}
```
An example of the complete directory structure is found below:
```
.
├── h5p-server.json
├── h5p-content
│   ├── blanks
│      ├── blanks-example-1
│         ├── content.json
│      ├── blanks-example-2
|         ├── content.json
├── h5p-libs
│   ├── h5p-blanks
│   ├── h5p-question
│   ├── <...>
```
With the above example structure, the h5p-server.json below is created to be able to view the Fill in the blanks H5Ps (located in the h5p-content/blanks directory):
```javascript
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 8080,
  "libraryDir": "h5p-libs",
  "mainLibraryDir": "h5p-blanks",
  "contentDir": "h5p-content/blanks"
}
```
To start the H5P development server with the above setup, run the following command from within the directory the h5p-server.json file is located:

`h5p server`

The development server should now be available at http://localhost:8080
